The arrival experience was horrendous. Had to wait 2 hrs in the Immigration line. The immigration offers don't speak English. They give hard time to all travellers. Departure Emigration was also the same had to wait in a long line to exit. They are making a new Terminal and hope it would transform the passenger experience with a greater comfort.",

                "text": "Careful. The Vietnam airport is full of scammers.  The currency exchange in the airport ripped me off. I gave 3020 baht. He gave me a quote of 2,178,000.00 dong. He gave me the stack of bills and only when I got to the hotel I found it was short 1,000,000. I've never had an illegitimate currency exchange at the airport before and just encountered it.\n\nAlso the taxi service charges 400,000. I compared it to grab and it was only 120,000. Rip off. When you search for your grab they have taxi drivers pretending to be your grab driver. Then when you bring up the screen to check, they point at your screen to show you it's them but make a quick move to try and cancel the other guy lol.\n\nThe first sim places you see charge you a lot but I skipped it luckily to discover it's much cheaper just down the escalator. The bathrooms have no toilet paper just like in Thailand so always bring your own.\n\nAs soon as you arrive, you must join a single line que which leads to another que. The 2nd que is a game of chance with multiple ques to choose from. Choose a lane and hope the immigration officer is fast. I chose a line. The girl behind me chose a different line yet she finished 30 minutes before I did because the immigration officer in my lane was really slow and thorough. Anyhow the airport is clean, the stewardess was nice and it was a good flight. But it gets a 1 for scammers.",
